## Requirements

Before running the project code, make sure you havej uputer notebook and  the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
```
If you dont have the jupyter notebook you can use a anaconda framework that has a jupyter notebbok .

# how to run code 
Before you need to clone our repositary 
## Clone this GitHub repository:
it is done by following command.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokul5557/IBM_project.git
```
Then navigate to the directory.
## Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd IBM_project
```
## Open the Jupyter Notebook for the code phase:

```bash
jupyter notebook AI_Phase5.ipynb
```
if you have anaconda framework then open anaconda prompt then type following command.
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This command open the jupyter notebook on your browser with the current directory 

Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code.

you can run the code by pressing "ctrl + Enter"
or you can run it by pressing the run button at the top below title bar .


## Final  Documentation
For complete project documentation, refer to the Project Documentation (AI_Phase5.docx) file.
That is the final document that has full detail about our project. with code and output
and screen shot of output of our code.
